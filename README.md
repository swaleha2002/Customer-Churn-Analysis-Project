# **Sales Analysis Using Power BI**  

## **Introduction**  
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Power BI. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and help businesses make data-driven decisions. The dataset includes details about products, customers, orders, and revenue across different time periods and regions.  

## **ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)**  
To ensure data accuracy and consistency, the ETL process was carefully implemented:  

1. **Extract**: Data was collected from multiple sources, including SQL databases and Excel files.  
2. **Transform**: The raw data was cleaned, formatted, and structured for analysis. This included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and adding calculated columns.  
3. **Load**: The transformed data was loaded into Power BI for visualization and further analysis.  

## **Database and SQL Setup**  
The sales data was stored in a relational database. SQL queries were used to clean and preprocess the data before importing it into Power BI. Key tasks included:  
- Removing duplicates and handling missing values  
- Creating relationships between tables (e.g., Customers, Orders, Products)  
- Performing aggregations to calculate revenue, profit, and sales growth  

## **Power BI Transformations**  
Once the data was imported into Power BI, the following transformations were applied:  
- **Data modeling:** Relationships between tables were established to create a seamless analysis experience.  
- **DAX calculations:** Measures such as Total Sales, Profit Margin, and Year-over-Year Growth were created using DAX formulas.  
- **Filters & slicers:** Interactive filters were added to allow users to analyze data based on different regions, products, and time periods.  

## **Key Insights from the Analysis**  
After visualizing the data, several key insights were discovered:  
✅ **Top-performing products** – Identified the best-selling products and categories.  
✅ **Seasonal trends** – Analyzed sales performance across different months to spot peak seasons.  
✅ **Customer behavior** – Segmented customers based on purchasing patterns and preferences.  
✅ **Regional performance** – Compared sales performance across different locations.  
✅ **Revenue growth** – Measured year-over-year revenue changes to track business growth.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project provided valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and market trends. Power BI's interactive dashboards helped in visualizing complex data, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
